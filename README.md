# Bachelor-Projekt
Currently, Astma-Allergi Danmark, as an organization, is responsible for manually collecting pollen data across Denmark. However, there is potential for improvement through the application of AI and machine learning. Due to a lack of collaboration with Astma-Allergi Denmark, this project aims to investigate the collection methods of pollen and develop an attempt to create an image recognition AI that can automate the organizationâ€™s manual processes.
